### 1) Be able to detect what a “shit-hole” state of mind is
A shit-hole state of mind, as defined by Khailee, is when you are in a mindset of lack: that your home country does not have enough talent, investors, customer, etc. His advice to startup founders? Recognise this mindset, and do something about it. Don’t just complain and bemoan your current situation without actively taking action to make a change. Khailee raised the example of him making the conscious decision to grow the tech talent pool in Malaysia where he is originally from, instead of giving up on it. He believes that a small decision can have a ripple effect on the society which we live in.

On the other end of the spectrum is the Silicon Valley state of mind, where you are in a state of complete abundance. Putting that into context, it’s the optimal state of mind where you feel like you are able to acheive your own potential for succeeding as a startup. He advises startups to make the choice to adopt the Silicon Valley state of mind wherever they are based, and as for Southeast Asian founders, he believes that there is no reason at all to be in a shit-hole state of mind and hate on your own country.

### 2) Learn to execute at the speed of the Internet
This is the attitude that you as a startup founder or someone working in a startup should adopt. It is the attitude of wanting to get things done quickly, to the point of getting things done now. A good example is sending out an email to a contact you’ve just met. It’s easy to say, “I’ll email you later tonight or tomorrow!” but in a world where smart phones rule, what’s stopping you from seizing the moment and sending out that email immediately? You are now living in the age of the Internet, likewise you should operate at the speed of the Internet (within reason of course).

### 3) Do whatever it takes to make your dreams come true
In an almost child-like manner, Khailee convinced us that sometimes dreams do come true, so dare to dream bigger! If you can’t even sell yourself and your idea, who is going to believe in you, seriously? And there’s a part two: You should really be prepared to do whatever it takes. He closed the sharing with the advice that we should all be open to doing whatever it takes to transform yourself into whatever identity you need to take on in order to succeed. This may mean picking up skills that are necessary to keep yourself hustling and to keep your business going.
