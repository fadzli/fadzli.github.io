<h3> WTF am I thinking? </h3>
<p>

I've done one on every possible mainstream host, ever since Geocities then to the modern day Wordpress.com, .org, Blogger, and even have a personal site live on tumblr at <a href="http://www.fadzli.co">Fadzli.co</a>, and time speaks volumes: that eventually my blogs always die cause I get lazy, and eventually forget the password.

But this blog is (slightly) different. It's more for my HTML/CSS/Rails journey than anythigs else. It's more about getting my feet properly wet in programming that delivering my sermons / baby pictures to the world. Ok, so it's not hardcore programming, but setting this baby up and understanding how Jekyll's engine works (and later on Octopress) is quite a feat, especially for the basic programmer in me.

So no images for this post, cause I have set that up yet. And OMG, the "rake" commands on this baby just blow my mind!
<p>
**This blog is in production for the total monthly sum of $0.00 on Github Pages, I recommend Github newbies have a look at that cause it's a good way to get familiar and f' around with Github commands and see how their cogs work.
